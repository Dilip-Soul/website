                <li><u>Real World Entrepreneurship:</u></li>
                 I have a group of 10 memebers for this entrepreneurship.
                 We began by brainstorming potential business ideas that would cater to our target 
                 customers—individuals living in hostels or as paying guests. After thinking several 
                 options,we decided to focus on <u>selling of Copies</u>. This choice was made based on the need for 
                 cost-effective, high-demand products that would be easy to source and quick to sell. 
                 The project was executed in phases, starting with a market visit to <u>College Street Market</u> in 
                 Kolkata, where we purchased our initial stock after negotiating with vendors. Our sales 
                 strategy included both online and offline promotions, targeting hostel and PG residents 
                 through word-of-mouth marketing, WhatsApp groups, and personal networks. We managed 
                 our finances carefully, tracking every transaction to ensure profitability while keeping prices 
                 competitive to attract more customers.
                 <br>
                 <i>Despite several challenges</i>—such as coordinating group efforts, managing finances, and 
                 balancing academic schedules—our team implemented strategic measures to overcome these 
                 hurdles. We successfully completed three phases of product purchases and sales, gradually 
                 increasing our revenue and reinvesting profits into subsequent inventory rounds. 
                 By the end of the project, we turned our initial investment of ₹1000 into ₹2500 a net profit of 
                 ₹1214.50. This project provided us with invaluable insights into the fundamentals of 
                 entrepreneurship, including the importance of teamwork, market research, strategic planning, 
                 and financial discipline. Overall, it was a highly educational and rewarding experience that 
                 has prepared us to tackle similar business challenges in the future.

            <h2>Research Thrust Area</h2>
            <p>I am intrested in Computer langueges reseach because Computer programming research focuses on the development and improvement of software systems, 
               algorithms, and programming languages. It explores ways to enhance computational efficiency, security, and usability across various platforms.  
               One key area of research is artificial intelligence, which seeks to create intelligent systems that can perform tasks autonomously.  
               Researchers also study data structures and algorithms to optimize how programs process and store information.  
               Parallel computing and distributed systems are other important topics, aiming to boost performance by utilizing multiple processors or machines. 
               Cybersecurity research works on developing techniques to protect software from attacks and vulnerabilities.  
               The evolution of programming languages is another focus, improving syntax, performance, and compatibility with modern hardware. In addition, 
               software engineering methodologies are researched to streamline development processes and improve code quality.  
               The integration of quantum computing into programming is an emerging field that could revolutionize computational power. Ultimately,  
               computer programming research shapes the future of technology, making systems more efficient, secure, and powerful.</p>
